What We Do
At Myristika Sustainable Solutions, we fuse advanced digital innovation with proven
environmental stewardship to address today’s most urgent natural resource and climate
challenges. Drawing upon our deep roots in the pioneering Forest-PLUS programs, we are
committed to catalyzing a transformation in how forest landscapes are managed, restored,
and governed—ensuring resilience for both ecosystems and the communities that depend
on them.
Building on a Proven Legacy
Before evolving into Myristika, our leadership and technical teams drove the landmark
USAID-supported Forest-PLUS initiatives, shaping the landscape of sustainable, data-driven
forest management across India and beyond. Through Forest-PLUS 2.0 and 3.0, we:
 Expanded the reach of sustainable forestry from a handful of divisions to over 185
forest divisions across 14 Indian states—impacting over 9 million hectares of vital
landscapes.
 Trained more than 7,500 individuals—including government foresters, community
members, and other frontline personnel—in modern digital forestry and
agroforestry practices.
 Developed, piloted, and institutionalized technological and methodological
innovations in State Forest Departments and key training institutions.
 Implemented ecosystem-based management plans that enhanced biodiversity and
ecosystem services while strengthening community livelihoods and establishing
equitable forest-based value chains.
Innovative Technology Suite for Natural Resource Management
Our core strength is the development and scaling of user-centric, policy-aligned digital
platforms that operationalize participatory, science-based, and climate-smart ecosystem
management. Our technology offerings include:
 Van System: A comprehensive, field-to-desk platform for real-time forest data
collection and analytics—supporting inventory, census, ecological monitoring, and
geospatial mapping. It streamlines reporting, compliance, and incident response
(including human-wildlife conflict), and optimizes field operations through a mobile
and web interface integrated with national guidelines.
 DSS-Ecorestoration: An open-source Web-GIS platform designed to address complex
restoration and ecosystem management challenges—supporting site planning,
species selection, fire management, and nursery tracking with robust spatial
analytics and multi-criteria decision-making capabilities.
 DSS-Agroforestry: A decision support system that empowers stakeholders across the
agroforestry spectrum by harnessing multi-layered geospatial intelligence for robust,

climate-resilient species selection, supply chain optimization, and policy
targeting—making agroforestry more viable, scalable, and sustainable.
 NTFP-IMS: A next-generation blockchain-based system ensuring trust, traceability,
and transparency across non-timber forest produce (NTFP) and agricultural value
chains. It provides seamless digital interfaces and marketplace integration, linking
producers, agencies, regulators, and buyers for both industrial procurement and
retail activation.
 TIGRAM: A geo-enabled digital chain-of-custody solution for timber, streamlining e-
permitting, provenance verification, QR-based traceability and full timber lifecycle
management—bringing transparency and robust compliance to the timber value
chain.
Shaping the Future: Our Vision for Impact
Building on the technical excellence and partnerships formed under the Forest-PLUS legacy,
Myristika is dedicated to driving broad-based, climate-positive impact through innovation
and collaboration. Our primary objectives moving forward are:
 Promoting ecosystem services-based approaches to landscape management and
restoration.
 Accelerating national and global climate, biodiversity, and sustainability goals.
 Developing AI, machine learning, and big data-enabled solutions for ecological
monitoring, analysis, and decision support.
 Designing and deploying cutting-edge GIS and remote sensing systems for real-time
landscape intelligence.
 Facilitating tech-enabled, community-driven governance architectures that
champion gender equity, Indigenous rights, and inclusive participation.
 Supporting robust capacity-building and the development of innovative
communication tools.
 Strengthening transparency, good governance, and cross-sectoral partnerships for
natural resource management.
 Mainstreaming technology-driven solutions to empower vulnerable communities
with sustainable, livelihood-enhancing opportunities.
Myristika offers a compelling opportunity for governments, donors, NGOs, academia,
foundations, and private partners to invest in validated, scalable solutions that address
pressing environmental and development challenges. By combining field-tested innovation,
institutional experience, and an unwavering focus on inclusivity and resilience, we are
charting new pathways towards an environmentally secure and equitable future.

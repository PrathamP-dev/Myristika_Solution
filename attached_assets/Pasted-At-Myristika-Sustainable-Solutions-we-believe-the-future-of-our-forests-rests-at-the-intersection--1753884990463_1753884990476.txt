At Myristika Sustainable Solutions, we believe the future of our forests rests at the
intersection of technology and nature. Fuelled by the urgent need to safeguard the planet’s
lungs, we bring together advanced digital innovation with proven principles of sustainable
and participatory resource management to reimagine the monitoring, restoration, and
governance of forest landscapes.
Forests sustain life—regulating our climate, protecting biodiversity, purifying air and water,
and anchoring the livelihoods of millions. Yet, they are increasingly threatened by
deforestation, habitat loss, and climate change. Myristika exists to meet these challenges
head-on, empowering a new era of natural resource management that is not only smarter,
but also more inclusive and resilient.
Our mission is clear: transform how forests and natural resources are managed—by
embedding real-time insights, predictive analytics, and participatory tools into every stage
of planning, oversight, and restoration. We strive for a future where technology and
community-led stewardship work hand-in-hand, ensuring both ecological security and social
equity.
What truly sets Myristika apart is our diverse, interdisciplinary team—blending the expertise
of environmental and social scientists, software developers, GIS analysts, policy strategists,
and community facilitators. Every solution we create is field-tested and co-developed
alongside end users, rooted in ground realities and refined for impact. Our platforms and
tools are not only aligned with national and global best practices, but also designed to
advance inclusive, gender-equitable, and rights-based resource governance.
Our journey began with the pioneering USAID-supported Forest-PLUS programs, where our
leadership expanded sustainable, technology-driven forestry across India—training
thousands, institutionalizing digital innovations, and strengthening community livelihoods
from village level to national policy. Today, Myristika builds upon this legacy, scaling proven
innovations and introducing next-generation tools for forest monitoring, eco-restoration,
agroforestry, value-chain traceability, and more.
We are Myristika: dedicated to a world where forests and communities don’t just
survive—but thrive, together.
